•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The mobile app that I designed to help someone who intending to lose weight. The app allows a user to login to their account and enter data entry points along with their weight goal. 

•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The application has a page that allows the user to login or create a new account if one doesn’t exist. I was successful in create a UI that was straight forward. 

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
When I first started working on this app I first started off my first layout page which was for the user login. I then worked on the data entry layout and then moved to the Data grid page.

•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I used a Andriod VM (Pixel 2 and other device) to run the application and make sure everything worked as intended and snapped to the right face or location.

•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I overcame a challenge when trying to have multiple fields being saved to the next page/layout, from the classes and information videos at the time I only knew how to bring one variable to the next layout.

•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
One way I showed off my knowledge and skills was how I changed the layout and color scheme to reflect SNHU.
